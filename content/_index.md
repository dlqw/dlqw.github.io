## About Me

Software developer specializing in game development and game development tools.  
I’m from [NJUPT](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/) and a core member of [SAST](https://sast.fun) and [HYS](https://github.com/HuaYe-Studio).  
Primarily C#, with exploration into Haskell and Rust.  
A GameJam enthusiast, feel free to reach out for 48-hour jams.   
Passionate about grand strategy and card games, sometimes dreaming up something remarkable.  
Currently transitioning from Unity to open-source engines, experimenting with contributing to them.   
The project I value most is a high-performance, out-of-the-box blueprint programming suite designed for non-professionals. Stay tuned for its release.
